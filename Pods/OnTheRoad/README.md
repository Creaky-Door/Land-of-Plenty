On The Road for iOS
==========

This is the official client for the Valhalla project (https://github.com/valhalla). It currently provides a basic implementation for pulling a route between multiple points, and is based on the work done by the good folks from TrailBehind for their GaiaGPS product (https://www.gaiagps.com/).

We're currently actively developing it for integration into our official iOS SDK (https://github.com/mapzen/ios). Keep an eye on that space along with this project for more information!
